# Motion Tests

- App screenshot transitions from angled/tinted to flat as you scroll.
- Logos carousel moves continuously with a seamless loop.
- Reveal animations play when each section enters the viewport.
- Reduced motion shows a static logo grid and a flat screenshot (no scroll-linked transforms).
